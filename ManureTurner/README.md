### Manure Turner

This will turn the manura mound you are standing next to. 
Locations:
- Granny Potterington's house at the Manor Farm and at Anachronia Dinosaur Farm 
- Anachronia Dinosaur Farm (Untested here)


I have random sleeps built in to make it seem more human but, your clicking a mound how long can someone really do that before getting bored? lol

There is no loot or anything to this, its a simple start and stop kind of thing. 

### Built With
This script requires slib from spector011 because we use his RecentMessageCheck function to see if we are tired and need to restart His library has been really helpful to me, if you haven't checked out his scripts you should they are amazing. It can be downloaded from him on his github: [found here](https://github.com/spectre011-code/Public-ME-Scripts/blob/main/Libraries/slib.lua)
