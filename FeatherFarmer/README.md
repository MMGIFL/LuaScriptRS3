### MemoryError Lua Scripts

I made this script as my first script that involved fighting. Here is what it will do:
- Kill Chickens  
- Pick up feathers and bones  
- Bury bones

This script can be run from anywhere as long as the chickens are close by. Please note I only tested this outside of Lumbridge and noticed many chickens have different IDs so if its not attacking chickens let me know the location and I will get the IDs of those chickens.

This script has no idling, no breaks, and doesn't eat food or use prayer â€” it simply kills, loots, and buries bones.

PS: I do use the old loot system, I am not sure if that will affect this for anyone.
