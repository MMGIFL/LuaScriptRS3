### OreFlow

This is a modified script, the original is from Spade and can be found here: [Spade Miner](https://github.com/spadeorsp8/spade_scripts/blob/main/spadeMiner.lua)

I wanted to farm ore and not worry about having a porter or having to path to a bank and handle depositing ore so I modified this script to not only look for ore to mine from but to also look for Anvils, Forges and Furnaces. What this script will do is:
- Search for ore within 50 tiles
- Search for Anvils, Forges and Furnaces within 150 tiles
- Mine the selected ore until full and deposit it at the selected Anvil, Forge or Furnace.

I am not good with UI so I built the deposit location into the ore location selection. Since I did that, you have to select your deposit location, then open the drop down again and select the ore you want to mine. It will then start on its own. 

I do not have an ore box so it does not currently use that. I tested this in a few places, one of them being the dwarf mines with the coal, it can mine the coal and then depost at one of the anvils at the entrence to the dwarfs hideout area(can't remember the name).
