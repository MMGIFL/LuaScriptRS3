<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I wanted to contribute to the scripts available for MemoryError as I enjoy writing code as a hobby. I learned LUA early on due to WoW and was excited to see this project for RS3. I have no college experience with coding and all of my coding is self taught so please don't be to harse on me when looking at my code. That being said I love to learn so if you have suggestions I would love to hear them!
